### 1.2 What Personal Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It

**Personal information** is defined as information or an opinion about an individual. If you can use the information to reasonable identify someone specific, that is personal information.

This can include names, contact details, photos, or location data. You can learn more from the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/handling-personal-information/what-is-personal-information){:target="\_blank"}.

We only collect the following personal information that you provide directly through your use of the app or its shortcuts, and always with your explicit consent.

| **Location**            | Your current device location (if enabled) to help track where a purchase occurred | Location access is only used at the moment of adding an expense and is not tracked in the background |

### 1.3 A note on the name you provide when you onboard onto the app

Please note that it is entirely ok for account names to be nicknames, initials, or other non-identifying labels (e.g. "ABC", "Trip Owner", "Partner", "Sisterr").

If you do choose to use your full name or another identifiable name, your related trip and expense data could also be treated as personal information under privacy laws.

To maintain your privacy, you can use non-identifiable labels mentioned above unless you explicitly wish to associate your name with expenses.

Your data is stored securely and remains within the app and is not shared with third parties.

<br>

## 2.0 What rights do you, as the data subject, have

You have the right to:

1. Access and review any data associated with your account.
2. Request that we delete your data.
3. Revoke permissions (e.g. camera, location) at any time via your device settings.

Your data is only stored for as long as your account is active or as required for functionality.
You can contact us in writing at any time to request or permanently delete data.

Identification checks may be asked if you request us to retrieve data associated with your account or request account deletion.
We will aim to retreive or delete data within 90 days of your request.

### 2.1 Account Deletion

You may request the deletion of your account at any time. This will permanently remove your personal information, including your email address, name, and any trip or expense data that is **not** shared with another user.

Please note:
If you have shared trips with a travel partner, the data associated with those trips (such as expenses and trip details) cannot be deleted, as it is part of another user’s account.

We preserve this shared data to maintain the integrity of your partner’s records (just like how a deleted email account cannot unsend emails).

<br>

## 3.0 How we store and secure the Personal Information we collect

All data is stored securely, which maintain industry-standard encryption and access control. No data is shared with third parties.
